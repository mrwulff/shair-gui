Thank you for downloading my chess clock!

A chess clock is usually used to time chess matches, but can be
used to time other games/activities as well.
I lacked one so I wrote this myself. It comes with no
guarantees, but I find it convenient.

To use this chess clock program, please install

Python 2.x from www.python.org
Pygame from www.pygame.org

Keys:

A/B: Start timers A and B, stop them and start the other (The button on top of the clock)

Q and G: Increase A and B by 1 minute respectively

Z and N: Decrease A and B by 1 minute respectively

Pause or P: Pause both timers (pause the game)
